# Tamagotchi Clone

#### Code by Christian Lo

#### A tamagotchi clone, made with JavaScript and the Phaser game library.

## How to run:
Assuming they haven't killed this link, check it out here: http://coolgamelamename.bitballoon.com/
Alternatively:
Download/Clone this folder onto your pc, and run via Firefox/Brackets live
launcher. Does not work for Chrome at this point in time.

## Controls:
Everything uses mouse input. Much of the gameplay elements
clone that of a tamagotchi. Your pet will automatically get
progressively unhappy/hungry in real time, so take care of it while it's on your desktop.

## How To play: 
You have a bootleg pet that you can play, feed, bathe, and ultimately take care of.
Click on the buttons on the screen to enter each feature. the features are listed as:
1. Scale: View stats of your pet. If your pet's happiness reaches 0, it gets mad; if it's hunger runs to 0, it "runs away". Use this to keep track of your pet's health.
2. Meat: Feed your pet. Eating an item consumes it, and you'll have to go to the store to get more.
3. Toilet: Sometimes your pet does its business. Click this to clean it up. Your pet will get sick if you don't
4. Activities: Play with your pet, or send your pet to work. This is a great way to recoup happiness/$
5. Fast Forward: For the impatient. Click on this to move the game forward a "tick" (measument of incremental time in game). Avoid spamming it unless you want to see your pet run away.
6. Floppy Disc: Save, Load, and Reset your pet's stats for later.
7. Medic Bag: Heal your pet if it's sick. Pet's hunger will rapidly decrease if it's sick.
8. Shop: Buy food/games to use on your pet.
9. Cog: Settings/Cheats. Enable/Disable certain modes, including a ninja invasion mode.
10. Pet: Click if you're in a menu and wich to return to the main screen.

If your pet "runs away" you should go to the save menu and reset your game.

## File structure:
"phaser.js" is library used in this project. The "main" file is found in "game.js", the functions that create a 
skeleton for the game is in "userInterface.js", and all other files correspond to their respective feature.

#### Enjoy! I really liked making this.
